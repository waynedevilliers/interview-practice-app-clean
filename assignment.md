    { role: 'user', content: generateQuestionPrompt(userData) }
  ],
  max_tokens: 300,
  temperature: 0.7
});
```

### 4. System Prompts with 5+ Advanced Techniques ✅

**CUTTING-EDGE PROMPT ENGINEERING**

**✅ Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**

```typescript
const chainOfThoughtPrompt = `Use Chain-of-Thought reasoning to generate question ${questionNumber}:

CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT PROCESS:
1. First, consider the role: ${jobRole}
2. Then, consider the difficulty level: ${difficulty}/10
3. Think about what skills are most important for this role
4. Consider what hasn't been asked yet
5. Generate a question that tests practical knowledge

Think step by step:
1. What aspect of ${jobRole} should I test?
2. What difficulty level ${difficulty}/10 concepts apply?
3. What specific question will reveal their expertise?

Generate ONLY the final question.`;
```

**✅ Few-Shot Learning Examples**

```typescript
const fewShotExamples = `Here are examples of excellent interview interactions:

Example 1 - Good Technical Question:
User: "I'm a Frontend Developer, difficulty 5"
You: "How would you optimize the performance of a React application rendering a large list?"

Example 2 - Good Feedback:
User Answer: "I would use React.memo and virtualization"
You: "Excellent approach! React.memo prevents unnecessary re-renders, and virtualization is perfect for large lists."

Example 3 - Handling Poor Answer:
User Answer: "I don't know"
You: "That's okay! Performance optimization typically involves reducing re-renders and lazy loading."`;
```

**✅ Role-Based Specialization**

```typescript
// Specialized prompts for different AI engineering roles
const specializationPrompts = {
  'LLM Engineering': `
    FOCUS AREAS:
    - Prompt engineering and optimization
    - LLM API integration and usage
    - Fine-tuning and model customization
    - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems
    - LLM evaluation and testing
  `,
  'ML Engineering': `
    FOCUS AREAS:
    - Model training and optimization
    - MLOps and deployment pipelines
    - Data processing and feature engineering
    - Model evaluation and monitoring
    - Distributed training and scaling
  `
};
```

**✅ Contextual Input Validation**

```typescript
// Professional handling of inappropriate responses
function isAppropriateResponse(response: string): boolean {
  const inappropriatePatterns = [
    /\b(profanity|inappropriate)\b/i,
    /[a-z]{10,}/i, // Random character strings
    /^\\s*$/, // Empty responses
    /^[^a-zA-Z]*$/, // No letters
  ];
  
  return !inappropriatePatterns.some(pattern => pattern.test(response));
}
```

**✅ Ideal Answer Generation**

```typescript
// Generate perfect answers using Chain-of-Thought
const idealAnswerPrompt = `Generate an ideal answer for: ${currentQuestion}

CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT PROCESS:
1. First, understand exactly what this question is asking
2. Think about what an expert in ${jobRole} would know
3. Consider the difficulty level ${difficulty}/10
4. Structure response showing technical depth
5. Include concrete examples and best practices

Provide a comprehensive answer that demonstrates:
- Deep technical understanding
- Clear communication
- Practical examples
- Best practices`;
```

### 5. OpenAI Parameter Tuning ✅

**OPTIMIZED FOR CONVERSATIONAL FLOW**

**✅ Conversation-Optimized Parameters:**

- **Temperature (0.7)**: Balanced creativity for natural conversation
- **Max Tokens (300)**: Concise but comprehensive responses
- **Model (gpt-4o-mini)**: Fast, cost-effective for real-time chat
- **Top-p (0.9)**: Quality control for consistent responses

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Optimized settings for different conversation stages
const conversationSettings = {
  questioning: {
    temperature: 0.7,  // Creative but consistent questions
    max_tokens: 300,   // Concise questions
  },
  feedback: {
    temperature: 0.3,  // Focused, professional feedback
    max_tokens: 200,   // Brief but helpful
  },
  assessment: {
    temperature: 0.2,  // Objective final assessment
    max_tokens: 250,   // Comprehensive evaluation
  }
};
```

### 6. Security Implementation ✅

**CONVERSATION-FOCUSED SECURITY**

**✅ Professional Content Moderation:**

```typescript
// Graceful handling of inappropriate responses
if (!isAppropriateResponse(userMessage)) {
  const currentCount = (userData.inappropriateResponseCount || 0) + 1;
  
  if (currentCount >= 2) {
    return {
      message: CONVERSATION_PROMPTS.INTERVIEW_ENDED(userData.name!),
      stage: 'complete',
      isComplete: true
    };
  }
  
  return {
    message: CONVERSATION_PROMPTS.INAPPROPRIATE_WARNING(userData.name!, currentCount),
    stage: 'interviewing',
    inappropriateResponseCount: currentCount
  };
}
```

**✅ Role Validation:**

```typescript
// Ensures focus on technical roles only
function isValidTechnicalRole(role: string): boolean {
  const technicalRoles = [
    'software engineer', 'developer', 'programmer',
    'frontend developer', 'backend developer', 'full stack developer',
    'ai engineer', 'ml engineer', 'data engineer',
    'devops engineer', 'mobile developer'
  ];
  
  return technicalRoles.some(techRole => 
    role.toLowerCase().includes(techRole)
  );
}
```

// Professional chat state management
interface ConversationState {
  stage: ConversationStage;
  userData: UserData;
  messages: ChatMessage[];
  currentQuestionCount: number;
  maxQuestions: number;
  isLoading: boolean;
}

// Natural conversation flow
const conversationFlow = {
  greeting: () => "Hello! I'm your technical interview assistant. What's your name?",
  job: (name) => `Nice to meet you, ${name}! What technical role are you preparing for?`,
  ai_specialization: (name) => `Great choice! What's your AI focus area?`,
  difficulty: (name, role) => `Perfect! What difficulty level would you like? (1-10)`,
  interviewing: () => "Let's begin your technical interview!",
  complete: () => "Thank you for completing the interview!"
};
```

### ✅ Advanced AI Prompting Techniques

**1. Chain-of-Thought Implementation:**

```typescript
// Step-by-step reasoning in prompts

1. First, understand the context and user's current stage
2. Then, evaluate what type of response is needed
3. Finally, craft a response that moves the conversation forward

Think step by step:
1. What was the question testing?
2. How well did the answer address the core concepts?
3. What was done well?
4. What could be improved?
`;
```

**2. Few-Shot Learning Examples:**

```typescript
// Built-in examples for consistent responses
const FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES = {
  goodQuestion: `
    User: "I'm a Frontend Developer, difficulty 5"
    You: "How would you optimize React performance for large lists?"
  `,
  goodFeedback: `
    User: "I would use React.memo and virtualization"
    You: "Excellent! React.memo prevents re-renders, virtualization handles large lists..."
  `,
  poorResponse: `
    User: "I don't know"
    You: "That's okay! Let me provide guidance on performance optimization..."
  `
};
```

**3. Role-Based Intelligence:**

```typescript
// Specialized question generation
const generateSpecializedQuestion = (role: string, specialization?: string) => {
  if (specialization === 'LLM Engineering') {
    return generateLLMEngineeringQuestion(role);
  } else if (specialization === 'ML Engineering') {
    return generateMLEngineeringQuestion(role);
  }
  return generateGeneralTechnicalQuestion(role);
};
```
