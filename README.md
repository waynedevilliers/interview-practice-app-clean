## 🤖 AI Models & Prompting

### OpenAI Integration

- **Primary Model**: GPT-4o-mini (fast, cost-effective)
- **Chain-of-Thought**: Step-by-step reasoning in prompts
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Built-in examples for consistent responses
- **Role-Based Prompting**: Specialized templates for different interview contexts

### Advanced Prompting Techniques

1. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**
   ```
   CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT PROCESS:
   1. First, understand the context and user's current stage
   2. Then, evaluate what type of response is needed
   3. Finally, craft a response that moves the conversation forward
   ```

2. **Few-Shot Learning Examples**
   ```
   Example 1 - Good Technical Question:
   User: "I'm a Frontend Developer, difficulty 5"
   You: "How would you optimize React performance for large lists?"
   
   Example 2 - Good Feedback:
   User Answer: "I would use React.memo and virtualization"
   You: "Excellent! React.memo prevents re-renders, virtualization handles large lists..."
   ```

3. **Role-Based Specialization**
   - **LLM Engineering**: Prompting, fine-tuning, RAG systems
   - **ML Engineering**: Model training, MLOps, deployment
   - **General AI**: Mixed approach with broader concepts

## 🔄 Conversation Flow

The application follows a structured conversation flow:

```
1. GREETING → Ask for name
2. JOB_ROLE → Validate technical role
3. AI_SPECIALIZATION → If AI role, ask for focus area
4. JOB_DESCRIPTION → Optional details (can skip)
5. DIFFICULTY → Set level (1-10)
6. INTERVIEWING → 5 technical questions with:
   - Question asked
   - User answers
   - AI provides feedback
   - AI shows ideal answer
   - Next question
7. COMPLETE → Final assessment
```

## 🛡️ Security Features
